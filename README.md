Programming Experience:


9th Grade Year: In the space below, write 2-5 sentences describing your programming experience in the previous year, even if you went to another school.


Last year was the year I was first really introduced to programming. We used things such as Python to get a better understanding of how programming works. We also were introduced to boolean values, integers etc.




10th Grade Year: In 2-5 sentences, describe each of the programming projects you’ve completed this year.  Think back to Block 1, Block 2/3, and your Passion Project (if that applies).


So far this year, we have learned a bit more about Python programming. We made a self rolling dice game, as well as a card deck. I also got to script a Discord Bot for my Passion Project which helped to boraden my programming skills.




What is one part or element of programming that you would like to improve or grow in this year?


I would like to improve on knowing what things to add to a script to make it do a specific action.


What is one part of programming or this class that you feel like challenges you more than others?


A lot of times, staying focused while programming is difficult. 


What is your “goal” with computer programming or Computational Thinking?  This answer can be focused on your time at school, or it could describe how you want to experience college or your future career.


My goal as far as computer programming is to learn enough so that I am able to teach others how programming works.
